# Wave Function Collapse Demo

This program demonstrates the wave function collapse method of dynamically generating landscapes.

In essence, you store the possibilities for each tile, then repeatedly choose a tile to collapse, propagating the collapse of possibilities to all the other tiles as needed. Once all the tiles have collapsed, you have the generated landscape.

As this is a demo, I dedicate the source code to the public domain under the Zero Clause BSD License.
